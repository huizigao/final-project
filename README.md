# Final-Project Outline
## Title
Using DeSEQ2 to inspect the gene expression differences from Esophagus cancer within T3N1M0 stage between a longer survival time section and a shorter survival time section
## Author
Huizi Gao
## Overview of project
male and country are controled, the key variable is the survival time. DeQUE2 is also be used to get rid of uninterested variables.

## Data
* the dataset I need can be downloaded from the ICGC portal. Here is the link:https://dcc.icgc.org. They are publicly available 
* sex: male
* country: UK
* we use 2.5 years(913 days) of survival time as a limit and divide the donors into 2 groups: a longer survival time section and a shorter survival time section. After examining clinical data, the former group has 31 tumor samples while the latter group has 60 tumor samples.
## Milestone 1
finish the initial draft of vignette 
## Milestone 2
load all of data and run them in vignette from the beginning to the end
## Milestone 3
perfect the process and generate a descritive report with all the details in the process.
